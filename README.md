# Cookiecutter template

## Intro
This template is meant as a basis for all python projects with a predefined structure for your python package.

## Getting started
To create a new project, install cookiecutter with pip and run cookiecutter referencing either a local clone or the git repository of this template:

```console
python -m pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/cvandijck/cookiecutter-python
```

Cookiecutter will ask information about the project, such as the project and package name.
From this information, a complete structure is created for the (imo) ideal python project.
